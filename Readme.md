# VibeCNI

This was started as a dare. Do not use this on anything important, or on anything at all, really. 
Most of this is Vibe slop, I'm really attempting to minimize the human in the loop.

# Docker
```bash
docker build .
```

# Does it work?

Absolutely not. But feel free to follow along as I try and abuse vibe coding.
